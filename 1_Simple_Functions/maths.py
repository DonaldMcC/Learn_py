# This will introduce the simplest of maths functions as everyone understands
# them.  Obviously there is no actual requirement to create these functions
# as python has them and many others built in.
# However it should provide the key features of functions in that they accept
# parameters and return a value.
# We will keep the add function super-clean but improve further ones with
# docstrings and options
